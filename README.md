# Data and Tools for BSci project on "The World Wide Web as a Physical Medium"

We are accustomed to hearing the terms "social "media" or "mass media" in reference to technology such as the World Wide Web (WWW). In physics, however this term bears different connotations involving understanding the behaviour of systems as we change its surroundings or structure. This begs the question - what parallels are there between the structure and dynamics of "social" media on the WWW and "physical" media?

Online social networks, which quantify human behaviour in a way not possible before, have become an important part of social relations worldwide, with sites such as Facebook exceeding 2 billion users. These media are of great significance in many industries ranging from government, perhaps in pushing across a certain political agenda, to marketing companies to advertise and increase sales of a product or service. 

Our project aims to investigate a dataset containing timestamped information on Facebook friends & wall posts data from New Orleans [1]. Python code will be used to probe a model of the network to extract metrics such as centrality measures, entropy, clustering coefficients and critical thresholds to obtain an understanding of the network’s resilience, as well as to discover analogies with physical media in terms of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

Other considered components are:

*	Analysing the exponents of power-law distributions, for instance of the degree distribution 
*	Investigating the applicability of thermodynamics and whether state variables such as entropy can be meaningfully assigned
*	Using timestamped data to investigate how certain metrics of clustering vary over time

Statistical mechanics on complex networks is well-established area [2] and meaningful insights have already been made by applying concepts from physics to social sciences in the context of the spread of ideas [3], thermodynamics [4], and the scaling behaviour of cities and companies [5]. This makes this a particularly exciting undergraduate BSc project!
